- Component is always exported as named export
- Component is always wrapped in `memo` from `react`
- Component has always a `displayName` set to the name of the component
- Components over 200 lines should be split into smaller components
- Small components ~20 lines can be placed in the same file as the main component
- Other components should be placed in separate files on the same level as the main component
- Hooks are always imported from `react` and are memoized where it's possible
- Complex logic should be extracted to custom hooks and placed in `hooks.ts` file
- Logic which is not related to React lifecycle should be extracted to utility functions and placed in `utils.ts` file
- Props are always separate type from component and are in `types.ts` on level of component
- Props are always exported as `type` and not `interface`
- Props are always named `${ComponentName}Props`
- Functions are typed with return type and parameters as separate types if they are complex
- Avoid calling API directly inside components, instead use composables
